### Question 1: Party Time
A four-digit number with different positive digits and with the numbers represented by its last two digits a multiple of the number represented by its first
two digits, is called a PAR. A pair of PARs is a PARTY if no digit is repeated and each PAR is a multiple
of the missing positive digit. I wrote down a PAR and challenged Sam to use it to make a PARTY. He was successful. I then challenged Beth to use my PAR and the digits in Sam’s PAR to make a different PARTY. She too was successful. What was my PAR?

### Question 2: Bilater Symmetry
My son, at a loose end after A-levels, asked me for a mental challenge, As we’d been discussing palindromes, I suggested he try to find an arrangement of the digits 1 to 9 with the multiplication symbol “x” to give a palindrome as the answer, and he came up with 29678x1453 = 43122134. I said “Now try to find the smallest such palindromic product starting in 4, where the last digit of the smallest number is still 3. He found that smallest product, and, interestingly, if he added the two smaller numbers instead of multiplying them, then added 100, he also go a palindrome. What was the smallest product?

## Prolog
### Question 3: Suko
Every day, The Times newspaper publishes a Suko puzzle. Readers are challenged to place the digits 1 to 9 in the cells of a grid so that numbers in four white circles are the sums of the digits in the cells surrounding them, and the numbers in the three coloured circles are the sums of the digits in the cells of the same colour.

### Question 4: The Bearings’ Trait
At Teaser Tor trig. point I found a geocaching box. The three-figure compass bearings (bearing 000 = north, 090 = east, etc.) from there to the church spires at Ayton, Beeton and Seaton were needed to decode the clue to the next location.

Each spire lay in a different compass quadrant (eg. 000 to 090 [sic] is the North-East quadrant). Curiously, each of the numerals 1 to 9 occurred in these bearings and none of the bearings were prime values.

Given the above, if you chose one village at random to be told only its church spire’s bearing, it might be that you could not calculate the other two bearings with certainty, but it would be more likely that you could.

Give the three bearings in ascending order.
